## Introduction

The LayerVault API provides a simple HTTP-based RESTful interface for interacting
with LayerVault. It adheres to the [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) standard.
Authentication can be done with OAuth 2, but is not required. All requests must use
SSL. All API responses are JSON objects.
